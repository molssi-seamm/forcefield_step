2023.5.1 -- Fixed bug in Lithium battery forcefield
  * Fixed a typo in the angle type unit line which caused a crash
    
2023.4.6 -- Added Lithium battery forcefield
  * An initial set of parameters for cathode materials, specifically LiCoO2.

2023.2.13 -- Added OPLS-AA forcefield
  * Added parameters for OPLS-AA along with some extra parameters for ionic liquids
    * PF6-
